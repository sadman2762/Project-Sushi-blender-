# Sushi Blender Project - README

## Project Overview
This project, named **Sushi**, is a comprehensive introduction to Blender, covering essential 3D modeling tools and techniques. It is designed to guide users from installation to more advanced topics like lighting setup. Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect of Blender, ensuring a solid foundation for 3D artists.

## Chapters Breakdown

### 1. **Introduction, Installation, and First Setup**
- Learn how to install Blender and set up your first project.
- Familiarize yourself with the Blender interface and settings.

### 2. **Basic Transform and Subdivision**
- Discover basic object transformations: move, rotate, scale.
- Understand subdivisions for adding complexity and smoothness to objects.

### 3. **Extrude and Loop Select**
- Use the **Extrude** tool to create new geometry from existing surfaces.
- Master **Loop Select** to efficiently select edges and faces for editing.

### 4. **Materials and Color**
- Apply materials to objects and adjust their properties.
- Explore Blender’s shader tools to add color and texture.

### 5. **Array Modifier**
- Learn the **Array Modifier** to duplicate objects in linear or radial patterns, essential for repetitive structures.

### 6. **Inset Tool and Outline View**
- Utilize the **Inset Tool** to add detailed geometry within faces.
- Manage complex scenes with the **Outline View** for easier selection and organization.

### 7. **3D Cursor and Linked Duplicates**
- Place objects precisely using the **3D Cursor**.
- Create linked duplicates to save memory and streamline changes.

### 8. **Camera Setup and Orthographic Projection**
- Set up cameras in your scene for rendering.
- Explore **Orthographic Projection** for technical or stylized non-perspective views.

### 9. **Lighting Setup**
- Implement various lighting techniques to illuminate your scene.
- Adjust light properties to enhance mood and depth.
